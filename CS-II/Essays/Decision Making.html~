      <p>One of the biases that may impact my decision making is the confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and to ignore or downplay information that challenges those beliefs. This bias can cause us to make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, as we may only consider information that aligns with our preconceived notions. As Wendy Smith, a psychologist at the University of Delaware, explains in the Hidden Brain podcast, "The confirmation bias is a really powerful force in our lives because it allows us to feel good about ourselves. We like to feel like we're right, and so we tend to look for information that confirms our beliefs, and we're less likely to look for information that might challenge or disconfirm our beliefs."</p>

      <p>Another bias that may impact my decision making is the anchoring bias, which occurs when we rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive about a problem and use it as the basis for our decision making. This can cause us to make decisions that are not well-informed or rational, as we may not consider all the available evidence or alternative perspectives. As Smith explains, "The anchoring bias is when we focus too much on a single piece of information, often the first piece of information we receive about a problem, and we use that as the basis for our decision making. And the problem with this is that it can lead us to make decisions that are not well-informed or rational."</p>

      <p>I also need to be aware of the overconfidence bias, which is the tendency to be overly confident in our own ability to make decisions, often leading us to underestimate the potential risks and uncertainties associated with a given decision. This can cause us to make overly optimistic or unrealistic decisions, as we may not consider all the potential consequences or alternatives. As Smith notes, "The overconfidence bias is when we're too confident in our ability to make decisions, and this can lead us to underestimate the risks and uncertainties associated with a decision. And the problem with this is that it can lead us to make overly optimistic or unrealistic decisions."</p>

    <div class="text-box-dark">
      <p>Another bias that may impact my decision making is groupthink, which occurs when members of a group or team make decisions based on the desire to maintain harmony and avoid conflict rather than considering the best options for the problem at hand. This can lead to poor quality decisions and a lack of creativity or critical thinking within the group. As Smith explains, "Groupthink is when we're more focused on maintaining harmony within the group and avoiding conflict, rather than making the best decision for the problem at hand. And the problem with this is that it can lead to poor quality decisions and a lack of creativity or critical thinking within the group."</p>

    <div class="text-box-light">
      <p>Finally, I need to be aware of the status quo bias, which is the tendency to favor the current state of affairs, even if a different decision would be better for the organization or problem at hand. This can cause us to make decisions based on inertia rather than considering the potential benefits of change. As Smith notes, "The status quo bias is when we favor the current state of affairs, even if a different decision would be better for the problem at hand. And the problem with this is that it can cause us to make decisions based on inertia rather than considering the potential benefits of change."</p>

    <div class="text-box-dark">
      <p>To overcome these biases, I need to take a more structured and systematic approach to decision making, gathering and considering a wide range of information and perspectives, including those that may challenge my initial beliefs. I also need to foster a culture of critical thinking and open-mindedness within my ISP team, encouraging everyone to contribute their ideas and perspectives without fear of criticism or disagreement. By adopting these strategies, I can avoid the pitfalls of decision making biases and make better, more informed decisions.</p>
