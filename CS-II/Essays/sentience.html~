    <h1>Logan Rohlfs - AI Sentience</h1>
    <p>
      The endless uses for Sentient AI will certainly improve our world but we have to be careful not to give it too much control. Even now, there are examples of AI improving our quality of life such as DeepMinds AlphaFold which is a neural network used to “predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from their one-dimensional amino acid sequences” We need to talk about, 3 ). This task has been troubling scientists for years and the ease at which the AI completes it is astounding. Another less serious example of the uses for AI is OpenAI’s DALLE-2 which is a neural network that can take in prompts written in regular english and transform them into completely new images. Alternatively DALLE-2 could be a tremendous threat to us as a society through its uses to create convincing fakes and deceive those who are vulnerable. There are also already examples of AI being used to spread mass misinformation and pass off as real humans in chat forums (We need to talk about, 8).
