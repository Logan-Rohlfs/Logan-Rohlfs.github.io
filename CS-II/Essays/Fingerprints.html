    <h1>Logan Rohlfs - Fingerprinting</h1>
    <p>
      The two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection are to ensure the user is using a secure, encrypted connection to sensitive or private information, and to ensure the connection itself was to the correct website. An HTTPS Proxy Appliance is the implementation of a pseudo CA by private institutions, corporations, and other corporations to intercept data before it reaches the intended target, logging it and or altering it then sending it on as if nothing happened. MITM stands for "man in the middle attack" meaning between the user and the intended target there is another party intercepting the data and passing it on between the two. MITM attacks can lead to identity theft, stolen credit card information, bank account information, and any further sensitive information. A hash is a transformation of a key/string of characters into another value that is easier to use in the operating system. Essential qualities that make a hash "good" are its inability to be converted back into the original key through a one-way hashing algorithm, and the use of many hashes in a hash table. A CA is a "Certificate Authority" that provides a certificate that verifies the authenticity of a public facing site through the use of mutually trusted providers. They help your browser verify that the site they are accessing is indeed the intended target and not a fake and the connection has not been altered. SSL interception cannot be prevented as the pseudo CA provider is indistinguishable from authentic CAs. SSL interception can be detected by obtaining the authentic fingerprint of the intended site and comparing it to the actual fingerprint on the browser. If there has been any altering or interception the two fingerprints will be drastically different. Generally false-positives are when a test comes back positive when it really wasn't and a false-negative is when a test that should be positive comes back negative. In the case of SSL interception there could be situations where the connection is truly authentic and it is other outside interference that causes the fingerprints to be different, and there could be specific sites the eavesdropper blacklisted from their interception to make the entire connection seem authentic.  While your school/government has a right to enforce software on their own devices, the extent to which the spyware infects other personal devices and accesses data that has nothing to do with the organization is not legal.
