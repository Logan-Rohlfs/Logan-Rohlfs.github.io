    <h3 style="text-align: center;">I was initially interested in this business proposal because of its application to my own life. A planning app such as the one brook proposes, would help me organize my life much better. I hope to see how it turns out. I chose not to accept this proposal because I feel like it lacks the complication of a year long project and would run out of ideas to implement</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">While I am certainly interested in creating a Facial Recognition program, I feel like it is an overstep of complication that cannot be achieved by High School students in a reasonable amount of time without copying code off of the internet. I certainly hope to see how this project turns out and if it does end up going well, I will regret that later. I wish the best of luck to cameron in this difficult project and I hope it goes well. </h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">I like the creativity in the name and idea and I feel like it has potential. My only worry is that there isnt much work to be done and that we would run out of stuff to do before the project end date. I cant wait to see how it turns our or what Mason contributes to other projects</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">The idea of one centralized hub for clubs and tutoring and extracurriculars of the like is very intruiging and has a real world application. Again I feel like this project doesnt have very much room to grow as it is in its simplest form, a glorified version of discord. I can't wait to see what innovative ideas evan and his team come up with but I regret to say that I will have to pass up on this opportunity.</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">I think the idea of using AI to make money is incredible and I would love to be a part of it. My only problems with the idea is that I dont personally have the best understanding of the stock market. In addition, I dont know how achievable the idea is because of its use of machine learning (pretty sure Mr. Ben said no machine learning).</h3>
 
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/timothy-andresen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">timothy-andresen - The Path (navigation system)</a></h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">While I love the idea and think that it has the potential to benefit alof of students, there are some flaws that led me to make the decision against accepting. The system would require access to the traffic light system which not only varies between cities and even individual intersections, but the only override access is given to first responders which have a higher priority than a school bus getting to school on time. I love the idea and cant wait to see how it turns out.</h3>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ibrahim-deir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">ibrahim-deir - 2D Fighting Game</a></h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">I feel like the idea is there but not fully fleshed out. The game description is very broad and doesnt inspire very much confidence in the completeion of the game by the end of the year. I cant wait to see what Ibrahims project turns into or what he does for the group he joins.</h3>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kingston-armstrong/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank">kingston-armstrong - Bullet Hell Game</a></h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">While I like the innovation of the idea, I feel like the main concept itself would get boring overtime. Beyond that, the levels of difficulty in coding a procedurally generated game is much higher than most anticipate. For that reason I will have to pass up on the opportunity to work with Special K</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">I love the idea and it would be of great use to myself. The issue is I dont see the achievability of this as converting between languages is no simple task and to code that all into an automatic program would take a certain level of genius. While I can't wait to see the results of this Business Plan, I myself dont feel like it will be achievable.</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Not only do I love the idea and see how it would help me whenever I am coding, I love the achievability of it and can see a future in which it becomes a full blown business. I would love to help work on the project and provide ideas to improve it.</h3>
