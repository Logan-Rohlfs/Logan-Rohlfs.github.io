      <h1>ISP Business Plan - SchoolFood</h1>
      <h2>Identity</h2>
      <h3>SchoolFood manages an online system for the school cafeterias to be used by students.</h3>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <h3>The lines in the cafeteria often take more than twenty minutes to get food. These times are caused by a buildup of students, cutting in line, and students' slow ordering.</h3>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <h3>Our solution is an online ordering system. It prevents cutting, allows students to talk with their friends or do some last-minute homework while waiting for their food, and speeds up overall speeds because the food staff does not have to wait for students to think of &amp; communicate their order. We employ a way to make sure students have to be in the cafeteria at the time of ordering as well as to stop preordering.</h3>
      <h2>Target Market</h2>
      <h3>The target market for our product is school districts or individual schools that have an issue with too long or slow lunch lines.</h3>
      <h2>The Competition</h2>
      <h3>The competition would be individual restaurants as some of them have their own ordering system. The reason we would be unique however is that most restaurants inside of schools have a different payment system, and their apps would need to be somehow locked down to students.</h3>
      <h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
      <h3>SchoolFood will sell our system to school systems. We can also charge a small percentage per order (much less than schoolpay!).</h3>
      <h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
      <h3>We would introduce our product at school conventions such as the Texas Association of School Boards / Texas Association of School Administrators Convention. We will have a marketing video that appeals to potential customers.</h3>
