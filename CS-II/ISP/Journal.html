      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <h2 style="display:inline">Technical Challenges - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">The technical challenges we have encountered so far deal mainly with github and file management. We were having issues with people pushing to the main branch and not the development branch. Last night some members discussed a plan to restrict access to push to the github to managers and release engineeers. While this will have to be implemented by Mr. Ben-Yaakov as he is the only one with access, we believe it will solve a large amount of our problems.</h3>

      <h2 style="display:inline">Scheduling Challenges - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">Alot of scheduling challenges have already come up in the short time we have been working on this project. The root of all of these challenges is the fact that our group having twenty-two members while also being spread into groupd of two or three across seven different class periods has made it very hard to get together and figure out times to meet. We worked on this last night in our online meeting and hope to use that as a means of communication in the future.</h3>

      <h2 style="display:inline">Technical Challenges - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">One of the technical challenges we have encountered has been figuring out the information we will be provided by the district so we can plan out our databases. This will hopefully be resolved in the near future when the school decides how they want to deliver this information. Another technical challenge is the privacy laws that prevent us from associating student ID's and emails with our third-party site.</h3>

      <h1>Team Role</h1>
      <h2 style="display:inline">Software Engineer - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">The software engineer is in charge of the main code base of the project and implementing features. They will also listen to the QA engineers and implement bug fixes when an issue it found. They are the backboard of any code based product. I think I am well suited for this role as I am very good at taking instruction and making sure the actual work gets done on time, I also want to work on my coding skills and this is the best opportunity to do so.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="display:inline">QA Engineer - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">QA Engineer stands for Quality Assurance Engineer. This means that they are in charge of bug testing and performance testing a product to make sure the user experience is as intended. They work closely with the Product Managers and Software Engineers to assure the project is going as planned and all bugs get fixed. Just like the previous role I see this as an opportunity to better my coding skills and in addition being able to identify and fix bugs.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="display:inline">Project Manager - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">The project manager is in charge of the bit picture concepts of the project and they organize the different sub-roles to make sure they are on task. They do less on the software side and more on the organization and plannign side to make sure the entire project is going as planned and in a timely manner. While I have good leadership experienc from football and have 100% confidence in being able to boss people around, I feel like this would be a detriment to my CS Education as I would not be coding as much as I would like to.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="display:inline">Product Manager - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">The product manager works with the Software and QA Engineers to make sure the product is acceptable and without bugs and issues. They do some of the coding but mainly keep the Engineers in line. They are second in command from a management standpoint and work closer to the actual Software than the overall Project Manager. While the product manager does more coding and actual work on the project, I dont see myself being good at this role as I would spend a majority of my time managing and less of it doing the actual code.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="display:inline">Release Engineer - </h2>
      <h3 style="display:inline">Release Engineers are in charge of planning and organizing the releases of the product and make sure that all bugs and issues are fixed before any code goes live. They will either fix issues themselves or delegate back to QA and Software Engineers, they are the last line before code makes it out to the general public and hold the responsibility of keeping the code consistant. I think I would be very suitable for this role as it means I would not only be able to work on the actual code like a Software Engineer, I would also work on identifying and fixing bugs leading to a more rounded CS Education.</h3>
